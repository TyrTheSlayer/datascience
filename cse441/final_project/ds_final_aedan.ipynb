        "### **Brief:** <br>\n",
        "Sports statistics and analysis is a growing and important element in the professional sports industry. In the past, a player may look good but not deliver with no direct way to explain it. The ability to read statistics and derive analysis can help players improve and managers create the best team.<br><br>\n",
        "In this project, I will utilize data collected by Open Source Sports [1] to demonstrate the possibilities of visualization and analysis of National Hockey League (NHL) player data from 1909 to 2011. As well, to fill in the recent data gap, data collected from Moneypuck.com will be added from the 2012 to 2021 season. Moneypuck does not contain the awards from the 2012 to 2021 season, therefore I will have to collect this from wikipedia and the NHL website and add it to the current awards CSV. \n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "The dataset contains a plethora of information in terms of scoring, playoff success, and coach success. However, the analysis will center around specific awards success. Hopefully, by the end of this project, we will see if underlying statistics and features can suggest who will win a particular award.\n",
        "This will include the awards:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The Vezina Trophy for exceptional goaltender\n",
        "*   The Norris Trophy for outstanding defenseman\n",
        "*   The Lady Byng Trophy for most gentlemanly player\n",
        "*   The Ted Lindsay Trophy for most exceptional player\n",
        "*   The Selke Trophy for most defensive forward\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis will not include the Art Ross or Rocket richard trophy as those correlate exactly to who earned the most points and awards respectively. As well, the Masterton trophy will not be considered as that is earned by an individual who has \"the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey\" and is often given to someone who has overcame hard injury or sickness. <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Notes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   It is recommended that when using this notebook to run each cell sequentially or all at the same time. If you run it out of order there could be issues with the observations matching the visualizations. Especially in the data sensitivity section, once the datasets are changed, all previous cells will not make sense if ran afterwards.\n",
        "*   It seems that the provided Goalies.csv has an additional row that has created parsing errors. The file goalies_2.csv was created by just removing the additional row.\n",
        "*   The dataset includes players that played exclusively in the former World Hockey Association (WHA) or the National Hockey Association (NHA) or played part time in those and later played in the NHL. Though, these teams become what we know as the NHL, I will not be including these in the full analysis due to differing rules, schedules, and other finer details.\n",
        "*  The 2012 to 2022 data comes from moneypuck.com [2] and each CSV are combined into large 'goalie22' and 'skater22' using the clean_combine_moneypuck_data() function. I am turning in the above files only to reduce submission size\n",
        "*  Colors for my graphs were selected with colorblindness in mind. I used the link at bibliography section [7] for guidance in contrasting color choices and [8] to generate colorblind friendly palletes\n",
        "*  I attempted to have all of my graphing functions that are called multiple times to be in their own functions for ease of use. However, for the feature superiority bar charts, the bar labels could not be applied without being called on their own.\n",

        "For the Lindsay award, the most significant feature that signifies the Lindsay is Points followed by assists. Like the Norris trophy winners, there are more Lindsay award winners that are superior in Points than any other player that season. This shows that a high amount of points can point to the Lindsay award winner. \n",

        "### **Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, it appears that most awards can be signaled by some feature in our dataset. Most notably:\n",
        "*   The Lady Byng Trophy winners correlate directly with a low amount of penalty minutes in a large amount of games.\n",
        "*   The Norris Trophy winners more often lead defenseman in assists and points \n",
        "*   The Ted Lindsay trophy winners, after adding the 2012-2022 data, more often lead other skaters in points.\n",
        "\n",
        "The other awards do have leaders in certain features, however, there are no features in which most award winners are better than other players. This either highlights a lack of important features in the dataset that does signal who should be the award winner or the human element of voting for the award winner incorporates elements that cannot be seen in data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of unique winners of an award is large for the Lady Byng and Selke trophy but remains even compared to repeat winners for the Vezina Trophy. The Norris trophy has more repeat winners than unique winners. I am unsure of what causes the Norris trophy winners to work this way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, with the violin plots, we can see how the more defensive minded awards of the Norris and the Selke each have lower densities/ranges for goals compared to the neutral awards of the Ted Lindsay and Lady Byng. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Data Sensitivity:**\n",
        "In terms of data sensitivity, adding 2012-2021 data does not significantly change the underlying attributes of the data. The mean and standard deviation of each feature only changes by a few decimal points. On a award by award analysis, the Ted Lindsay award gives more information with it's increased datapoints. The number of unique winners for each award went up, which could mean newer players are standing out for the awards or voters could be selecting new winners because they are unique. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Future work:**\n",
        "I would like to apply some machine learning methods to see how accurately the data can be used to predict who will win each award per season. I would like to better analyze the negative features like losses, ties, or penalties. I have only looked at general shape of these features but there could be better signals in the number of losses. As well, I would want to find a way to survey voters for this award to analyze their thought process on how they select their award winners. This could be compared with the features and improve awards predictions. Unfortunately, this would probably not be possible, but it would help the analysis by involving the human element of the voter.\n",

        "#### **What I have learned:**\n",
        "In the process of this project, I have learned a few things. \n",
        "*  First and foremost, this project has solidified my python skills beyond my personal projects and any homeworks. Utilizing pandas between multiple dataframes has been useful and interesting.\n",
        "*  I learned the importance of choosing a good color pallete for visualizations. I am not colorblind but I sometimes struggle discerning the colors in some visualizations, so focusing on how to make my analysis accessible was enlightening. \n",
        "*  Data cleanup is very important, the amount of NaN errors I ran into was super annoying but they only came because I neglected to clean my data well at first\n",
        "* I learned better processes for understanding and combining datasets of similar purpose with different feature values. The Moneypuck.com data has most of the values as the hockey database data, however, combining them required more detail than I expected.\n",
        "*  Not all features are about having the most of that feature; a player does not want the most losses, ties, nor penalty minutes. Intuitively, you would just compare players that have the least number of the bad features but the noise of players that have only played 1 game and received no losses or penalties makes that impossible for good output. I still do not know what is best for analyzing performance in those statistics, but, having the chance to think through it has been insightful. \n",
        "*  Lastly, this project helped me learn how to select appropriate visualizations for the data I wanted to present. \n"
